# TODO: Remove Spacing in Reviews Sections

## Steps:
- [x] Edit index.html: Add CSS classes and rules to reduce vertical spacing around "Most Common Positive/Negative Reviews" headings, buttons, and lists. Specifically:
  - Add classes to h2 and button elements for targeted styling.
  - Update the main <style> block with new rules: .reviews-h2 { margin-bottom: 0; }, .reviews-btn { margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 10px; }, #negativeList ~ h2 { margin-top: 10px; } (to tighten space between sections), and adjust ul margins.
  - Wrap positive and negative sections in divs with class="reviews-section" for better control (positive: margin-bottom: 20px; negative: margin-bottom: 0;).
- [x] Update TODO.md: Mark the edit as completed.
- [x] Test the changes: Reload the page to confirm reduced spacing in the UI.
